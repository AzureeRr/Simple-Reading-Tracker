# The Reading List

## Welcome to The Reading List app!

This is a simple command-line tool built in Python that helps you manage the books you’re reading. It allows you to:
- Add new books to your reading list
- Track your progress by marking pages read
- View a list of all your books with their details
- Search for books by title or author
- Remove books from the list
- Persist your data in a CSV file for future use

## Features
- **Add books**: Easily add new books by specifying the title, author, and total pages.
- **Update progress**: Track your progress by updating the number of pages you’ve read.
- **Search functionality**: Search your book list by title or author.
- **Remove books**: Remove books from the list when you’re done with them.
- **Data persistence**: Your book list is saved in a CSV file (`books.csv`) and will persist between app sessions.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:
- **colorama**: For colored terminal output.
